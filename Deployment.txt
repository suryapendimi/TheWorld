1.Add a Pacakage.json file (of type NPM configuration file)
add the dependencies..
2.Add a gulpfile.js (of type gulp config file)
refer to the files..
3. Open a cmd prompt
	npm rm --global gulp 
	$ npm init "project path"
	$ npm install --save-dev gulp
	E:\Projects\Web\TheWorld\src\TheWorld>gulp minify
	u would see response as ...
	[19:56:43] Starting 'minify'...
[19:56:43] Finished 'minify' after 186 ms
if you go back and see _app foler u see the minified versions of js files
if u make a changes in js files.. need to execute gupl commands to update min files.
u can open 'Task Runner explorer' by right click on gulp file and click refresh icon and under Tasks -->minify and "run"
u would see response as 
[20:10:05] Using gulpfile E:\Projects\Web\TheWorld\src\TheWorld\Gulpfile.js
[20:10:06] Starting 'minify'...
[20:10:06] Finished 'minify' after 182 ms
Process terminated with code 0.

4. After minified versions created need to point them based on Env. varible
for Dev we can use non minified versions..
for QA,PROD use min version.. we need to wrapp these in <environment> tag
We may use "Task Runner Explorer" for minification.
5. We need gulp-ng-annotate to correct the $http,$routeparams to help out in minification process.

Add this below setting to project.json which tell what to be installed on different env. and in which order etc.,
6.  "scripts": {
    "prePublish": [ "npm install", "bower install" ],
    "prepare": "gulp minify"    
  }

7. We can use VS2015 publish or can use DNX for command line deployment.
